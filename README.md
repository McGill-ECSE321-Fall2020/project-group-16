## Project Scope
Our ArtGallery Application provides features for artists, customers and the employees of the art gallery to buy, sell and view art. The website allows all features to be accsessed, however our mobile app has limited features for the users. 

(Your application must support the scenarios described for every stakeholder. All functionality of the system needs
to be accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders. In addition, a mobile (Android) frontend shall
allow the execution of the most important functionality for the given stakeholder, i.e. it shall have both read and
write access to the backend via RESTful service calls. External systems or services are not required to be integrated.)
